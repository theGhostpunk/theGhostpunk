I am a biologist-turned programmer, composer and visual artist. 

I educate myself in the fields of biomedical signal processing and machine learning in addition to computational neuroscience, but I also seek to develop software for other artists to expand their creative arsenal.

I code in various languages such as Python, C++, Java, R and MATLAB; however my main tools are C++ and Python.
